1.EXISTING SYSTEM:
The Existing Algorithms provides most important benefits are interpretability. Generally, agricultural department stores the information about the different factors that leads to crop yield. It mainly focuses on   production increment and productivity of agricultural crops using environment friendly science and technology while ensuring increased net farm income to the farmers through various schemes, programmes and welfare measures. However, does not investigate the root cause for the decrease in crop yield/agriculture risk. They store the information manually. This information is not used for future analysis. So, further prediction from previous data is required.

DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM:
The existing system results in the following drawbacks:
•	It does not predict the future scope of the yield.
   
2. PROPOSED SYSTEM:
Our project processes the data collected from records of agriculture departments which are stored manually through data visualization  tools like  weka/tableau/R tool. The result  will be presented in a graphical format for easy understanding of user. By using this result the agricultural department will make a decision for future crop production. This will minimizing risk increasing the crop production.
	We are using tool kit in the Data Analyzer of Microsoft Excel. We are deploying the Residual plots by using regression function which is provided in the tool kit. 
                                                                                                         
ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
 The proposed system results in the following advantages:
•	Proposed system gives the esstimted value of yield depending upon values of rainfall and area of crop
•	 It is easy to take a decision on future crop production.
